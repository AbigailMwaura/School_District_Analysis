# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The goal of the project is to separate high school students based on their performance with the passing rate being >=70%. Thomas High School has  been from the overall evaluation due to the outling results from the ninth grade class.However, the results of Thomas High School will be present throughout the analysis in separate data frames. Factors utilized for this analysis include grade level, school type, and size of the school.

###### Resources used: 
Jupyter notebook, Python code and csv documents provided by the school districts

## Results
###### How does removing Thomas High School affect the district summary?
In as much as the assumption was, that removing Thomas High School 9th graders would improve the district summary data, there was little to no change in both Reading and Math Scores. Most likely because Thomas High School data lives in a big pool of school district data and only a small portion of students are part of Thomas High School.
###### How is the school summary affected?
Removing the 9th graders had a drastic effect on how the rest of the school performed . The passing rate went from 90.6% to 65.1%. 
###### Effect relative to other schools?
Thomas high school moved from being one of the highest performing schools to one of the worst

## Summary
Based on the results above, replacing 9th graders from Thomas High School has no effect when it came to the reading and math scores based on school size and type. However, in comparison to other schools, Thomas High School's performance saw a significance decline because the level of comparison was larger than what we saw when it was only school data rather than the entire school district.
